-- But as of 2024-09-11, the latest version of the `unix` 2.8.5.1 package has a conditional bound on `filepath` depending on the `os-string` flag (see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-2.8.5.1/dependencies).
-- With no extra parameter or setting, we get a dependency conflict on `filepath`, as other libs use a version of `filepath` incompatible with the one `unix` wants.
-- Setting `filepath` to 1.4.2.2 fixes that.
constraints: filepath ==1.4.2.2
