-- A note on implementation: to avoid silly mistakes, very easy functions are
-- simply reimplemented here. For harder function, we reuse the Prelude
-- definition and make an unsafe cast.

-- XXX: Add runtime-representation polymorphism such that
-- `($)`+`-XImpredicativeType` (starting with 9.2) has the complete behaviour of
-- GHC's native `($)` rule.
