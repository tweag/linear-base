{-| The type

> Data.List.unzip     :: [(a,b)] -> ([a],[b])

   might lead us to expect

> Streaming.unzip :: Stream (Of (a,b)) m r -> Stream (Of a) m (Stream (Of b) m r)

   which would not stream, since it would have to accumulate the second stream (of @b@s).
   Of course, @Data.List@ 'Data.List.unzip' doesn't stream either.

   This @unzip@ does
   stream, though of course you can spoil this by using e.g. 'toList':

@
\>\>\> let xs = Prelude.map (\x -> (x, Prelude.show x)) [1..5 :: Int]

\>\>\> S.toList $ S.toList $ S.unzip (S.each' xs)
["1","2","3","4","5"] :> ([1,2,3,4,5] :> ())

\>\>\> Prelude.unzip xs
([1,2,3,4,5],["1","2","3","4","5"])
@

    Note the difference of order in the results. It may be of some use to think why.
    The first application of 'toList' was applied to a stream of integers:

@
\>\>\> :t S.unzip $ S.each' xs
S.unzip $ S.each' xs :: Control.Monad m => Stream (Of Int) (Stream (Of String) m) ()
@

    Like any fold, 'toList' takes no notice of the monad of effects.

> toList :: Control.Monad m => Stream (Of a) m r %1-> m (Of [a] r)

    In the case at hand (since I am in @ghci@) @m = Stream (Of String) IO@.
    So when I apply 'toList', I exhaust that stream of integers, folding
    it into a list:

@
\>\>\> :t S.toList $ S.unzip $ S.each' xs
S.toList $ S.unzip $ S.each' xs
  :: Control.Monad m => Stream (Of String) m (Of [Int] ())
@

    When I apply 'toList' to /this/, I reduce everything to an ordinary action in @IO@,
    and return a list of strings:

@
\>\>\> S.toList $ S.toList $ S.unzip (S.each' xs)
["1","2","3","4","5"] :> ([1,2,3,4,5] :> ())
@

'unzip' can be considered a special case of either 'unzips' or 'expand':

@
  unzip = 'unzips' . 'maps' (\((a,b) :> x) -> Compose (a :> b :> x))
  unzip = 'expand' $ \p ((a,b) :> abs) -> b :> p (a :> abs)
@

{- Remarks on the design of zip functions

Zip functions have two design choices:
(1) What do we do with the end-of-stream values of both streams?
(2) If the streams are of different length, do we keep or throw out the
remainder of the longer stream?

* We are assuming not to take infinite streams as input and instead deal with
reasonably small finite streams.
* To avoid making choices for the user, we keep both end-of-stream payloads
* The default zips (ones without a prime in the name) use @effects@ to consume
the remainder stream after zipping. We include zip function variants that
return no remainder (for equal length streams), or the remainder of the
longer stream.
