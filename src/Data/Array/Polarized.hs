-- The general spirit is: `Array` are those arrays which are friendly in
-- returned-value position. And `PullArray` are those arrays which are friendly
-- in argument position. If you have more than one array in an unfriendly
-- position, you need to allocate (allocated arrays are friendly in all
-- positions).

transfer :: Pull.Array a ->. Push.Array a
transfer (Pull.Array f n) = Push.Array (\g -> DArray.fromFunction (\i -> g (f i)) n) n

-- | This is a shortcut convenience function, which does the same thing as
-- `transfer` . `Pull.fromVector`
walk :: Vector a ->. Push.Array a
walk = transfer . Pull.fromVector
