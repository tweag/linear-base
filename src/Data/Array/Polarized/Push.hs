-- TODO: the below isn't really true yet since no friendly way of constructing
-- a PushArray directly is given yet (see issue #62), but the spirit holds.
-- TODO: There's also a slight lie in that one might want to consume a
-- PushArray into a commutative monoid, for instance summing all the elements,
-- and this is not yet possible, although it should be.

-- | PushArrays are those arrays which are friendly in returned value position.
-- They are easy to create and can be constructed by supplying elements in any
-- order. Dually, they are harder to consume as they will supply their elements
-- in an unknown order, and allocation is generally required for consumption.

  -- An invariant is kept that, really, the first parameter is only passed
  -- arrays of size @n@ (the second parameter, which is the length of the
