-- | An array destination ('DArray') is a form a constructor for arrays, which
-- make it possible to create by adding a new element to it in
-- O(1).
--
-- Destination-passing style is common in C programming, where we pass a mutable
-- data-structure to a function, whose responsibility it is to fill the array.
--
-- Through linear types, however, we can expose array destinations as /pure/
-- data structures (even though, operationally, filling the destination is
-- implemented by mutations under the hood). Moreover, we make sure that each
-- cell in the destination will be filled exactly once (in particular no cell
-- will be forgotten), and we can't read cells in the destination, therefore
-- there is no risk of reading an uninitialised cell.

-- XXX: use of Vector in types is temporary. I will probably move away from
-- vectors and implement most stuff in terms of Array# and MutableArray#
-- eventually, anyway. This would allow to move the MutableArray logic to linear
-- IO, possibly, and segregate the unsafe casts to the Linear IO module.
-- @`alloc` n k@ must be called with a non-negative value of @n@.
