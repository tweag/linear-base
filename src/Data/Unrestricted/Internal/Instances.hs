-- | This module exports instances of Consumable, Dupable and Movable
--
-- We export instances in this module to avoid a circular dependence
-- and keep things clean. Movable depends on the defintion of Ur yet
-- many instances of Movable which we might have put in the module with
-- Movable depend on Ur. So, we just put the instances of Movable and the
-- other classes (for cleanness) in this module to avoid this dependence.
