-- | This module introduces primitives to /safely/ allocate and discard
-- in-memory storage for values /explicitly/. Values discarded explicitly don't
-- need to be managed by the garbage collector (GC), which therefore has less
-- work to do. Less work for the GC can sometimes mean more predictable request
-- latencies in multi-threaded and distributed applications.
--
-- This module is meant to be imported qualified.
--
-- == Examples
--
-- You can find example data structure implementations in @Foreign.List@ and
-- @Foreign.Heap@ of the @example@ directory in the source repository.
--
-- == Pools
--
-- The module interface is structured around a notion of memory 'Pool'. Passing
-- linear pool arguments is an alternative to passing continuations to
-- functions. Passing continuations can break tail-recursion in certain cases.
--
-- Pools play another role: resilience to exceptions. If an exception is raised,
-- all the data in the pool is deallocated.
--
-- Data from one pool can refer to data in another pool and vice versa.

-- XXX: [2018-02-09] I'm having trouble with the `constraints` package (it seems

  -- Storable comes with a lot of machinery, in particular for
  -- architecture-independent alignment. So we can depend on it.
  --
  -- So, we restrict ourselves to known instances that we trust. For base types
  -- there is no reason to expect problems. Tuples are a bit more subtle in that
  -- they use non-linear operations. But the way they are used should be ok. At
  -- any rate: in case a bug is found, the tuple instances are a good place to
