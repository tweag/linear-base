Linear base is a collection of all the standard library code one needs to
develop applications with linear types. It is named `linear-base` to be an
analog to the original [`base`] package that ships with GHC.

**The purpose of `linear-base` is to provide the minimal facilities you need to
write _practical_ Linear Haskell code, i.e., Haskell code that uses the
`-XLinearHaskell` language extension.**

## Motivation: Why do you need `linear-base` to write practical linear projects?

* First, if you are writing a linear function, you cannot use the standard
  non-linear data types, functions and classes in `base`. For instance, something
  as simple as `n + 1` for a linearly bound argument `n` will not type check.
  We need linear variants of `Functor`s, `Monad`s, `($)`, etc.

* Second, there are several primitive data structures, functions and classes
  that can only be safely released with `-XLinearHaskell`. _Some of these are
  new and exciting because they are not in `base`._ For example, the API for
  file IO released by `linear-base` is safe unlike the current API for file IO
  in `base` which allows, for instance, reading from a closed file handle.
  Consider another good example: `linear-base` releases a safe API for mutable
  arrays, that are updated in-place.

## Getting Started

Please follow these instructions carefully without skimming :)

1. In your stack project, add our [`shell-stack.nix`] and [`nixpkgs.nix`] files.
2. Edit your `stack.yaml` to have these fields:

```yaml
resolver: lts-14.6
compiler: ghc-8.9
allow-newer: true
system-ghc: true

nix:
  shell-file: shell-stack.nix
  path: ["nixpkgs=./nixpkgs.nix"]

```
3. In your project, just do `stack --nix build` to build, and `stack --nix
   test` to test and so on.
4. Add `linear-base` to your cabal file's `build-depends:` for the appropreate
   library or executable. In your `stack.yaml`, add the `linear-haskell` package as an
   `extra-dep` from GitHub. **Don't forget to use a recent commit.**

```yaml
extra-deps:
  - git: https://github.com/tweag/linear-base.git
    commit: 5dcb68d52229753f381110e8b0bb681245080235
```

5. You're done! Profit. To learn more about stack nix integration, see
[here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/nix_integration/).

## User Guide

If you already know what `-XLinearHaskell` does and what the linear arrow `a #-> b`
means, then read the [User Guide] to know how to use `linear-base` and look at
the [`examples`] sub-folder.

## Learning about `-XLinearHaskell`

If you're a Haskeller who hasn't written any Linear Haskell code, don't fear!
There are plenty of excellent resources and examples to help you.
