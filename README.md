Linear base is a standard library for developing applications with linear
types. It is named `linear-base` to be an analog to the original [`base`]
package that ships with GHC.

The purpose of `linear-base` is to provide the minimal facilities you need to
write _practical_ Linear Haskell code, i.e., Haskell code that uses the
`-XLinearTypes` language extension.

## Motivation

_Why do you need `linear-base` to write linear projects?_

1. Data types, functions and classes in `base` are not linear types
  aware. For instance, if `n` is a linearly-bound `Int`, the RHS of
  a definition cannot write `n + 1` — this will not type check. We
  need linear variants of `Num`, `Functor`s, `Monad`s, `($)`, etc.

2. This library exports new abstractions that leverage linear types
  for resource safety or performance. For example, there are new APIs
  for file and socket I/O as well as for safe in-place mutation of
  arrays.

## Getting started

`-XLinearTypes` is released with GHC 9, and `linear-base` is released
on [Hackage][hackage-pkg] and [Stackage][stackage-pkg].

All source files with linear types need a language extension pragma at
the top:

```
{-# LANGUAGE LinearTypes #-}
```

## User Guide

If you already know what `-XLinearTypes` does and what the linear
arrow `a %1-> b` means, then read the [User Guide] and explore the
[`examples/`](./examples) folder to know how to use `linear-base`.

## Learning about `-XLinearTypes`

If you're a Haskeller who hasn't written any Linear Haskell code, don't fear!
There are plenty of excellent resources and examples to help you.
